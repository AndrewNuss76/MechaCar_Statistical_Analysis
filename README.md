## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
To determine what variable is able to predict MPG, we ran a linear regression using all 6 variables to determine what variable has the most significance. When evaluating the graphic below, vehicle_length and ground_clearance were the two most significant variables to predict mpg. We can determine the slope of the model is not 0 when we evaluate the p-value, which is 5.35X-11. Therefore we can reject the null hypothesis. In summary, based on the adjusted r-squared, our model can predict 68% of the variance.
